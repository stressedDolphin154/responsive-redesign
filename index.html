        <h2>Page Overview</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this assignment was to go through the process of designing 
            a webpage and learn how to analyze a webpage to determine its usability problems. I choose 
            one of my favorite restaurants near my university to redesign their page!

        <h2>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems </h2>
        <h3>Picking a Webpage</h3>
        <p>
            The webiste I choose was the home page of Al-Shami 
            on Thayer St. I choose this website becuase upon opening I was confused 
            where to start and wondered what the colors indicated and what are the elements
            on the page that are interactive.
            The website link is <a href = "https://www.abuyarub.com/" target="_blank"> here.</a> 
            Below is a screen shot of the page I will be redesigning. 
        </p>
        <div> <img src = "./pics/al-shami-page.png" alt ="current al-shami home page"></div>
        <h3>Finding Problems</h3>
        <p>Using the critera of usability, learnability, and memorability these are the problems I found with the website:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    When hovering over the menu bar, there is no indication that the items are links or would lead you to 
                    anywhere else.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the menu bar the resturant is referenced as Abu Yarub Al-Shami, but on the home page in big letters,
                    it only says Al-Shami which confuses the reader as to what resturant this is actually for. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The user must memorize and learn that the first green and yellow box is not a button, but 
                    the order online and explore menu are.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The menu bar is both at the top and bottom of page, but look slightly different. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is unclear why Welcome is written in all caps
                </li>
                <li>
                    When adujsting the page the separate text next to the order and explore does not always stay in the middle,
                    or align with the button. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Conceuptually, the user would want to explore the menu first before ordering online. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The website is not responsive when it comes to translating the page. 
                </li>
            </ol>


        </p>
        
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>After doing WAVE on the webpage, I was shocked to see that ther were no errors. However,
            after further insepction of the alerts and features there are some accesibility problems.
            Many of the images have alt tags, but the tags are empty. This is not good for someone who
            might be using a screen reader and then unable to hear what images on the website are being
            displayed. WAVE also alerts that there are a few redundant links. This problem I agree with,
            and aim to fix in my redesign of the home page.

    <h2>Part 2: Visual Redesign</h2>
    <h3>Low-Fi WireFrame</h3>
    <p>The wireframes were created using balsimic. This new wireframe address the issues of the button, menu bar, and
        order hierarchy that is not seen in the orginal page. 
    </p>
    <div class = "photos-container"> 
        <img src = "./pics/Low-Fi Responsive-1.jpg" alt = "desktop low-fi prototype" >
        <img src = "./pics/Low-Fi Responsive-2.jpg" alt = "iPhone low-fi prototype" >
        <img src = "./pics/Low-Fi Responsive-3.jpg" alt = "tablet low-fi prototype" >
    </div>
    <h3>Style Guide</h3>
    <p> These colors and icons will appear in the final version and the high-fi prototypes. Note: the style guide changed after building the 
        webpage as I realized that the colors did not fit well together. 
    </p>
    <div> <img src = "./pics/style-guide.png" alt = "style guide" ></div>
    <h3>High-Fi Prototype</h3>
    <p>These prototypes were created using figma and used the wireframes and style guide to build 3 different versions of the page. I updated
        the style guide after completing and annotating the wireframes thus the colors on theses frames are not what appears on the final website. 
    </p>
